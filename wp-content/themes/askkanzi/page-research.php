        <h2>1968 <span class="badge badge-secondary">Scientific Research</span></h2>
        <p>Dr. Duane Rumbaugh conducts comparative studies on the ability of nonhuman primates to reason, plan, and engage in inferential thinking. He finds that only apes are to able engage in human-like reasoning processes on the transfer-index task at the San Diego Zoo. He is a member of the faculty at San Diego College. He obtained his Ph. D from the University of Colorado in 1955.

        The bonobos Matata and Bosondjo are born in the Congo- they are probably related to the older femal Lokelama, and all three will be caught together in one net in 1975 and brought to the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center. Their offspring now reside in Iowa.
      </p>
      <p>
         Three wild-caught bonobos arrive at the Yerkes Primate Center, on lend-lease from the Congolese government, under the auspices of a program funded by the office of Navel Research, to determine if they are new species of ape, or a subspecies of the chimpanzee. The stated goal is to return these three bonobos to the Congo within a few years and to establish a federally funded research center in the Congo, after differences in their reproductive cycle and that of the chimpanzee are established. This project was initiated by Carl D’jerrassi the inventor of the birth control pill.

        <h2>1970 <span class="badge badge-secondary">Scientific Research</span></h2>
        <p>The Language Analog Research Project begins at the Yerkes Primate Center. It is funded by NICHD and directed by Dr. Duane Rumbaugh who is the Associate Director of the Yerkes Primate Research Center. 
  2. There are initially two ape subjects, a baby orangutan (BJ) and a baby chimpanzee (Lana), both females.  The original room for the project is 8 x 10 feet. </p>
  <p>
  Upon a visit to a friend in Norman, Oklahoma. Dr. Sue notices a poster at the Un. of Oklahoma that is advertising lecture – to be presented by Dr. Fouts and a chimpanzee named Booee, who has learned American Sign Language for the Deaf. She attends the lecture and is startled to see a nonhuman producing gestures when show a bowl, a hat, a pipe, etc. Lecture attendees are invited to visit “the chimp farm” and learn more the following day. She does so, and learns of the 30 chimpanzees there all with different backgrounds. Some have been in circuses, some are from the wild, some have come from zoos, some from rodeos, some are being raised by humans, some live in a captive colony, some live on an island, etc. She is shocked at the differences between these various chimpanzees, their backgrounds, there housing conditions, etc. She also finds gibbons living on island, families of several different macaque species in enclosures, baboons, peacocks, and various other nonhumans just 20 minutes from the edge of town. She is allowed to return and assigned to teach Booee more ASL signs. Aware that the vast variety of nonhuman beings, especially some who appear to be acquiring language, is not to be found elsewhere and aware that at Harvard she would focus on pigeons and the relationship between their behavior and that of human beings, she decides to enroll at the University of Oklahoma and being Ph. D. studies there instead. Many question the wisdom of this decision noting that it will affect her job opportunities in the future. She remains firm – feeling that the there is much more to be learned from the living beings there, and that if she works hard, surely a job will be available somewhere.</p>
    <p>
     Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh begins her graduate program at the University of Oklahoma working chimpanzees Lucy, Booee, Bruno, Alle and Wahsoe who are acquiring sign language under different rearing conditions as well as  with Petal, Pampy, Carrie, Shadrack, Meshak, Mimi, and Manny – chimpanzees being reared by their natural mothers in a mother-infant group. Her focus is upon language and nonverbal behavior in apes, as a function of differential rearing environments.

          <p>Nyota is born. He is the first son of Panbanisha and the first third generation bonobo born into the Language Research effort.

        <h2>2002 <span class="badge badge-secondary">Administrative</span></h2>
        <p>Mr. Townsend establishes the Iowa Primate Learning Sanctuary(IPLS) a nonprofit organization and begins construction of 15 million dollar sanctuary for the purpose of studying language in bonobos and gorillas and humans with language acquisition difficulties. He invites Peter Gabriel and Mr. Woodruff to assist him in moving the bonobos to Iowa. They decline. </p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend visits GSU and gains administrative approval to relocate the bonobos to Iowa for $450,000.00.</p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend promises lifetime care of the bonobos and lifetime positions to Dr. Rumbaugh and Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh in return for GSU agreeing to move the world-renown project to Iowa.</p>
        <p>Peter Gabriel, Steve Woodruff (of the Coca Cola Foundation) and Mr. Hyashibara of the Hyashibara Corporation in  Japan come together to sponsor a plan to move the bonobos to Hawaii in cooperation with the University of Hawaii, Penny Patterson and possibly Roger Fouts to continue the ape language studies.</p>
        <p>Paul McCarntney and his entourage pay a surprise visit to the LRC. Mr. Woodruff is contact by Paul McCartney regarding this visit. He meets Mr. McCartney at the gate and ushers him and his entourage into LRC.  Mr. Woodruff has been a contributor to LRC of significant means and he has strongly opposed the GSU plan to relocate the bonobos to Iowa, on the grounds that the research trajectory will be harmed if this relocation takes place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend arrives at the same time, prepared to make a presentation to the nonprofit entity "ApeNet" which was formed by Mr. Woodruff, Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Hyashibara for the purpose of relocating the bonobo family to a safe location which would allow the research trajectory to flourish and to continue. The presentation of Mr. Townsend is not well received by the members of "ApeNet, " who view Mr. Townsend as interested in establishing a zoological facility for the purpose of making money rather than providing and adequate research facility. </p>
        <p>Mr. Fields supports Mr. Townsend's presentation as does Dr. Washburn. Mr. Fields was a Research Associate that time and responsible for various aspects of the research program, in particular the archiving project and the move toward an anthropological perspective.  Dr. Washburn contacted Mr. Fields to determine how it was that Mr. Cartney and his entourage gained access to the facility. The GSU administration was very upset that the visit had occurred. Mr. Fields explained Mr. Woodruff's role in the event causing a rift between them. Mr. Fields then began working on an operational design for an educational project that would appeal to Mr. Townsend and that would located within the Iowa Child Facility. </p>
        <p>IPLS was officially formed by Mr. Townsend and he begins to relocate funds from tax dollars into the IPLS nonprofit corporation. </p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend determined that he wanted the bonobos to be move to Iowa, so that they might become a part of the Iowa Child Project that he was proposed to build in Iowa.  Mr. Townsend travel to George State University where he met with Georgia State official and provided them with $450,000. In return GSU promised bonobos to Mr. Townsend and a written contract was signed between these two groups (Mr. Townsend and GSU). </p>

        <h2>2003 <span class="badge badge-secondary">History</span></h2>
        <p>The City of Des Moines loans 200 acres to IPLS with the provision that it be employed for the housing of nonhuman primates and associated educational activities.  The lend lease agreement states that should the project fail the land will be returned to the City of Des Moines.</p>
        <p>The parcel of land was selected from seven parcels offered by the city. At that I was not told that the land was in a flood plain.  I was aware that the land was near the river, however it was bounded by a levy.  I was told that the levy would prevent flooding.</p>
        <p>The land was donated by the city, in a lend lease agreement. The agreement specified that a facility would be constructed for ape and that should the project fail, the buildings and the land would revert to the city.</p>
        <p>Initial building meetings with architects are held and the first building plan is presented.  At these planning meetings I learn the land is in a flood plain. Mr. Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute attended this meeting accompanied by someone who was familiar with flood plains. This expert argued strongly and forcefully against building in the current location, because it was a recognized flood plain.  According to this expert, the location would flood and we could not avoid this happening at some point. In addition he argued that the sandy substrate would not prove suitable for a facility and that the substrate could shift over time as underwater pathways carved new channels underground. This expert was overruled by the architects. They assured  me that it was possible to build up a pad which would keep the building out of the flood plain. Following this meeting, I traveld to Omaha to work with the architects and the building is redesigned specifically to accomplish the needs of the research trajectory. </p>
        <p>Following this meeting Mr.Townsend, myself, Mr. Fields and Mr. Brocker met with NICH officials in Washington to describe the planned location of the Language Research Center to the Iowa Primate Learning Sanctuary in Des Moines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend decides to invite an orangutan project from the Smithsonian to also relocate to Iowa. </p>
        <p>A second building is begun for the orangutans and is completed before bonobo facility. The orangutan project is led by Dr. Ben Beck, joining his team are Dr. Rob Shumaker, Dr. Karyl Swartz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al Setka is named PR director for the project. (Mr. Setka is a current member of the Ape Initiative board).</p>
        <p>The name Great Ape Trust is adopted as the public named for IPLS. Mr. Brocker is named Project Director. </p>
        <p>The bonobo building design is feature in a leading architectural magazine and it architect Peter Hinde is awarded an excellence in design.  The building is represented as Lead's certified building. Amory Lovins  points out that it is in a flood plain and needs to be relocated.</p>
        <p>After the above meeting Mr. Townsend and Mr. Broker announced that they were going to the Smithsonian National Zoological Society to meet with Dr.'s Shumaker and Beck regarding the relocation of their project to the Iowa Primate Learning Sanctuary.  We were not invited to that meeting, even though the ostensive purpose of that meeting was to convince Dr.'s Beck and Shoemaker to join the facility being constructed in Des Moines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend and Mr. Brocker travelled to Des Moines after meeting with Dr.'s Shumaker and Beck. The indicated the following:
          a) that the bonobo facility was going to be downsized by half
          b) that an orangutan facility was going to be constructed
          c) that the bonobos facility should contain a large classroom and that I was to focus on 
          teaching exercises daily in that classroom, with the bonobos as backdrop.
          I stated that in my view was that this would significantly interfere with the research and I could not approve placing a large classroom in the middle of the bonobo facility. In response to that statement Mr. Townsend indicated that I must then submit a grant immediately to NICHD to cover the research costs. Prior to that time, the plan had been to complete the facility and to get the research up and running before resubmitting to NIHCD.  This had been advised by the Peggy McCardle when we met with her in Washington DC, just prior to Mr. Townsend's meeting with Dr. Shoemaker and Beck. I agree to submit the grant through GSU as per Mr. Townsend's instructions, however I indicate to him that a grant for work in a facility not yet construction will have zero probability of getting funded. This fact is of no concern to Mr. Townsend or to Mr. Brocker. 
          </p>
          <p>The architect of the bonobo building resigned from the Leo A. Daily firm shortly thereafter. The building was downsized by more than a factor of two. It appeared to have been redesigned more or less by a computer than by a architect, as the downsizing was done by halving rather than redesigning.  The new architect was unfamiliar with the research needs and/or the research trajectory.  The new architect designed a second building which was to used to house orangutans from the Smithsonian Zoo. It was a square slab building. </p>

        <h2>2004 <span class="badge badge-secondary">History</span></h2>
        <p>The grant to NICHD is denied. The reason given is that Dr. Sue has structured the planned proposals around the design of a facility that is not yet constructed. She is invited to resubmit the grant, once the facility is actually in place. </p>
        <p>The orangutans Inda and Azy are relocated to Iowa, followed in 6 months by the bonobos, Matata, P-suke, Kanzi, Panbanisha, Nathan, Nyota, Maisha and Elykia. </p>

        <p>The construction of the orangutan building began first. It was to be completed first and the orangutans were to be relocated before the bonobos. The explanation given for the orangutans receiving first priority was that Dr. Shumaker's demonstration project at the Smithsonian been given a termination date by the Smithsonian Zoo. He needed to move quickly. In addition Dr. Beck had been removed from the Smithsonian faculty because he was deemed responsible for the death of two red pandas. The pandas died because a exterminator placed materials in their cage designed to kill rodents and the pandas ate these materials. Dr. Beck was responsible for the hiring and supervisor of the exterminators.  </p>
        <p>
          GSU gave a drop-dead date by which the bonobo building had to be completed or the bonobos would go to a zoo. The delay in receiving the bonobos, due to placing the orangutan building as the first priority on the list caused David Washburn, the new director of the Language Research Center (LRC) great concern. He so expressed this to Mr. Fields, though not directly to me.  It was relayed to me and I therefore began to try to speed up the construction of the bonobos building. The drop dead date was the Spring of 2005. 
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Sue moves to Iowa during last 8 months of completion of the bonobo building.  Upon arrival she learns that time Dr. Shoemaker and Dr. Beck were making extensive changes in the bonobos building. They are redesigning the bonobo to house gorillas. They  have been given the rights to "sign off" on the various stages of the bonobo plan, rather me, by the CEO Mr. Brocker. With the redesigns underway two things were occurring a) the building was being changed toward a zoological facility and away from a research facility and b) it was being modified to house gorillas not bonobos. </p>
        <p>Dr. Sue  requests that 'sign off' rights on the construction plans be returned to her, as I she is now on site. She also requests that many of the modifications planned for gorillas be retracted. She requests that construction of the bonobo building be given higher priority so that the building would meet the GSU anticipated timeline. She goes directly to Mr. Townsend to request these alterations and her requests are accepted.</p>
        <p>The PR director (Al Setka) and a PR firm that he has hired, informed us that a name and image change for the facility was underway.   Dr. Shumaker and Dr. Beck have had chosen a new name for the facility. It was now going to be called the "Great Ape Station," rather than the Iowa Primate Learning Sanctuary. We are also informed that Dr. Beck was arranging for gorillas to be brought to the facility and that Dr. Shoemaker was arranging for 30 to 40 chimpanzees to be housed there in the future. We were told that we must join the AZA and meet their requirements. (The AZA had previously objected to the bonobo research because it rejected, in principle, human/ape interaction, except in the sanctuary of Claudine Andree in Kinshasa.) The name change marked a turn toward establishing a zoological part, and away from establishing a research facility.  Dr. Duane Rumbaugh  strongly objected to the naming the facility "GAS," and to the requirement that we had to join the AZA. Following months of debate, Mr. Townsend selected the name Great Ape Trust.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shoemaker and his "research team," Dr. Beck, Dr. Swartz and Dr. Wick were all relocated to Iowa. </p>
        <p>Mr. Potter, the lawyer hired by Mr. Townsend to make certain that all the orangutans and bonobos were properly transferred to GAS/IPLS, requests a private meeting with Dr. Rumbaugh and myself. At that meeting, he indicates that Dr. Beck and Dr. Shoemaker are planning to remove me not long after the bonobos are relocated to Georgia and that these plans were made in collaboration with the Atlanta Zoo, who was claiming that it owned Matata, Elykia and Maisha.  However it did not own either one, and neither one had ever been housed at the zoo. In fact, no bonobos had ever been housed at the Atlanta Zoo. The Zoo was claiming that Yerkes had transferred Matata to the Zoo and that Matsuzawa of Japan transferred P-Suke to Matata.  Later it indicated that it was willing to trade the bonobos it owned for gorillas, after the bonobos were  were relocated to Iowa. Phase one of the plane was to remove me and phase two of the plan was to move the bonobos to Zoo Atlanta. </p>

        <h2>2008 <span class="badge badge-secondary">History</span></h2>
        <p>Mr. Townsend offered me a contract to sign that would allow me to return but with very limited access.</p>
        <p>I returned  to find that the bonobos had been generally kept apart, especially the males as a matter of policy by Elizabert Pugh. Because of this, the males were constantly fighting through the mesh. I had never encountered such behaviors in this group (or any bonobo group) prior to my removal.</p>
        <p>I returned and I was given more access. I was not permitted to direct anyone, to teach anyone or to work closely with anyone.  I was not permitted to collect data because Rob's students and staff and graduate students working under Fields are given first priority.</p>
        <p>Nyota asked to go in and visit Kanzi. I had not told that Kanzi and Nyota had been kept apart during my absence. When Kanzi entered, he displayed at Panbanisha and passed by pushing her. This upset Nyota who bit Kanzi on the foot. He appeared to break his mandible during this bite. The mandible was repaired however the dentists indicated that he was still likely to loose his upper right canine, which did later occur. Prior to this,  Nyota had never bitten another bonobo. He also do not participate in play-biting as do other bonobos.  It appeared that Nyota did not have the knowledge of how to bite that bonobos gain through play biting. </p>
        <p>Takashi, whom the bonobos have know for at least 10 years, was removed as staff supervisor and replaced by Tyler. This change resulted in further disorganization within the bonobo group and an increasing separation between the daily world of the staff, their communications with the bonobos and the world of the bonobos. Tyler was the newest person in the lab, having been there only a year. He lacked the respect and the trust of the bonobos. In fact, the bonobos detested Tyler.</p>
        <p>Kanzi did not approve of this or of the appointment of the new supervisor, nor of the demotion of Takashi. When I indicated to Kanzi that we are going to have to do what Tyler told us to do, Kanzi bite me on the mouth. (This is the first and only time that Kanzi has bitten me.)</p>
        <p>GSU veterinary staff visited the day that I told Kanzi we were going to have to do as Tylor requested.  I was asked to make a presentation to this group regarding the research.  Following the presentation these veterinarian indicated to visitors at the laboratory that the bite on my mouth was a herpes lesion and that I had obtained this lesion from Kanzi.  From the appointment of  Tyler to the position of supervisor, rumors such as this regarding my interactions with the bonobos, began to flood the lab on a regular basis.  With the appointment of Tyler as staff in place, Mr. Fields began the process of obtaining "Animal Assurances."  These were documents, provided by ALAW, to certify that the laboratory had met strict training and over-site practices. An ALAW "animal assurance" number was required before a grant to do research with animals could go forward.</p>
        <p>The building flooded with 5 feet of water on June 8.  All power was shut off and the building was accessible only by boat. The bonobos survive by staying in the tunnels that were designed to connect the caging. During this period, essentially all feeding and care is performed by Liz Pugh and myself. The staff are present to help move items out of the building and to bring food into the building however they do stay in the flood waters. The water as reported to be highly toxic and we are asked to keep the bonobos out of them. There is no way to do this other than to explain to the bonobos that they should not be in the water because they are toxic and to ask them to stay away from the water and to confine themselves to the small tunnels. The bonobos are nonresponsive to the requests to do so by the staff, but they do attend to the requests and explanation made by myself and by Liz Pugh, daily, in this regard.</p>
        <p>
           The bonobo staff will not care for bonobos under the dangerous flood conditions so Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh and her sister Ms. Liz Pugh care for the bonobos 24/7 for two weeks. During the following months bonobo Nathan and Ms. Pugh develop cancer. Both were in the dangerous flood waters far more than the other bonobos or than Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh. 
        </p>
        <p>Nathan and Liz Pugh developed cancer 3 to 6 months after the flood. They were the two individuals most exposed to the flood water. Nathan was more exposed than the other bonobos because he was the youngest and he kept wanting to play in the water. He was the least likely to listen to our explanations of why the bonobos had to stay out of the water because he was the least able to comprehend them. Liz was the person in the water the most because the Trust provided inadequate waders and she was constantly wet. She also spent the most time with Nathan attempting to convince him to go out of the water and to stay out of the water. I purchased my own waders and was thus protected from the water. I do so because I considered the waders provided by the Trust to be inadequate.</p>
        <p>Zoo Atlanta claims ownership of Matata and Maisha and requests their return to Atlanta. Mr. Fields asks them to provide ownership documents which they fail to  provide.

      <p>
         Mr. Townsend announces his funding will terminate at the end of 2010 as the ruling of the Army Corps of Engineers is a “death blow” to the Master Plan for Great Ape Trust.

      <p>
         BHI (Bonobo Hope International) is established to raise funds to care for the Bonobos beyond 2010. The members of that board included most of the current members of BHI.
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Sue was given permission to assist Itai Roffman in gathering data for his Master's. Itai's access was extremely restricted, as was Dr. Sue's, however she was given more access in order to assist Itai.</p>
      <p>Mr. Townsend announced, through Mr. Aipperspach, that he would decrease funding by one million a year and stop all funding by the end of 2011. </p>
      <p>Mr. Setka, Mr. Townsend and/or others determined that the bonobos should have a baby. Elykia and Kanzi were selected as the parents because they are the most distantly related members of the group.  The Approval for this pregnancy was given by the IACUC.  With this approval the staff become more confident that the program will somehow be continued.</p>
      <p>With the approval of Mr. Fields, Dr. Sue contacts the Templeton Foundation and begins the application process to the foundation for funding. </p>
      <p>Mr. Fields removed the laboratory from the AZA following a demand to relocate Matata and Maisha to Zoo Atlanta.  Mr. Fields requested that Zoo Atlanta provide proof of ownership. Zoo Atlanta did not do so but continued to insist that Matata and Maisha be relocated to the their zoo. At that time they had no other bonobos in their collection. The AZA supported the request of Zoo Atlanta and made plans to relocate other bonobos to the zoo once Matata and Maisha arrived. Mr. Fields removed the bonobos from the mandatory birth control that the AZA required for the group. Mr. Fields received IACUC approval to remove the females from birth control as long as other, nonchemical methods of birth control, were utilized. The use of these other methods was placed under the direction of Tyler and it involved various housing constraints upon the bonobos. The bonobos greatly resented these constraints.</p>
      <p>The bonobo caging in the West End of the building was removed and replaced with caging capable of holding orangutans and/or gorillas.</p>
      <p>Mr. Fields filed the interpleader action with the Federal District Court in an attempt to require Zoo Atlanta to validate its ownership of Matata and Maisha.</p>

   Dr. Ursula Goodenough – current BHI member organizes support to oppose the relocation of the bonobos. 
</p>
<p>A Inter-Pleader lawsuit is filed with Federal District Court by Mr. Fields asking the court to determine who owns the bonobos.
</p>

<p>Panbanisha became clearly pregnant. She ceased mensing and began to exhibit signs of pregnancy.  I explained this to Tyler and indicated that pregnancy tests should be run and that if they were positive she should be place on prenatal vitamins for her health and well-being. However Tyler insisted that that she was not pregnant. He insisted that he ran pregnancy tests and found her not to be pregnant. She produced an still born infant. This infant was most unusual and did not look like any other bonobo baby I had seen previously (I had seen, by that time, two other still born babies - all born in Iowa, and the following live born infants, all born in Atlanta, Kanzi, Panbanisha, Tamuli, Elykia, Maisha, Nyota and Nathan.) This baby was different, very very different. 
</p>
<p>In June, Teco was born. He did not breathe for three hours but he appeared to be alive because there were small movements in his tongue. I was advised to wait because infants can survive without breathing for some time as long as the placenta remains attached and is delivery oxygen.
</p>
<p>Teco lacked the clinging reflex in his feet.  As he grew older it becomes increasingly difficult for Elykia to carry him because of this. 
</p>
<p>Elykia began to seek the assistance of Matata, Kanzi and Panbanisha in the care of Teco by leaving him with them for increasing long periods of time so that she can move about. Whomever is caring for Teco has to either carry him or sit still with him because he is not able to hold on his own for more a few minutes. </p>

      <p>Mr. Townsend resigns and turns the Chairmanship of IPLS over to Dr. Ken Schweller, a psychologist from Storm Lake Iowa. The members of BHI become board members of IPLS upon the resignation of Mr. Townsend and his board. The new board is composed of scientists. 

    </p>
    <p>
       Mr. Townsend sets aside one million dollars in transition funds for the bonobos. 

    </p>
    <p>
       Mr. Schweller removes Mr. Fields from the position of director.  This trigger the withdrawal of the one million dollars of transition funding is withdrawn. 

    </p>
    <p>It also triggers the letting go of staff who worked under Mr. Fields as there are not funds to pay them. They ban together as “the bonobo 12” and demand the facility be turned over to them. Mr. Schweller refuses to do so. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh begins a fund-rising effort for BHI/IPLS
</p>
<p>The USDA stops this effort stating the facility’s exhibitor’s license was terminated for failure to pay the fee by IPLS in 2010.

<p> Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh funds the facility from her retirement account for 2 years, till the exhibitor’s license can be renewed with the USDA.

      <p>The bonobo 12 attack Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh, and request that the facility and the bonobos be transferred to them.
</p>
<p>
   The IPLS board conducts in depth study of their claims. They find that the claims are based on heresay and that the staff working directly under Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh provide extremely strong support for her. This stong support includes Gaila Conklin, who is working at AI at the present time.  

</p>
<p>The exhibitor’s license is obtained and fund-raising recommences in late 2012. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh proposes that the facility become part of NIH’s ape sanctuary program and she contact Dr. DeWaal who is a scientific advisor to Chimp Haven, the initial first NIH sanctuary.
</p>
<p>Panbanisha dies.  On 11/16/12 Panbanisha (age 26) receives an injection of antibiotic about 7:00 pm and dies 15 minutes later The press reports the death is due to pneumonia but on autopsy no active pneumonia is found. The cause of death is listed as septic shock. Just prior to death she was eating, drinking and moving around easily. Panbanisha was co-reared by Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh, Ms. Pugh and Matata. The other bonobos experienced her death devasting as did the humans within the facility.  Panbanisha had become the matriarch of the colony and all depended upon her, especially Teco, Matata, and Nyota. She was the most advanced of the bonobos with regard to self-control, language production, language comprehension, artistic competence, musical competence and stone tool production. 
6. Following this proposal Mr. Caudill, a friend of Mr. Simpson’s arrive from Washington DC. After visiting with him, Mr. Simpson requests that the IPLS board members  move back to the BHI and focus on science. He advises that Mr. Caudill will chair a business board and raise funds for the facility. 
</p>
<p>The scientists are leery of this proposal and agree to accept it on the following conditions:
     a) The science board (to be called BHI) will lease and operate the bonobo 
      facility
     b) The science board will determine the research trajectory and oversee the
      science 
     c) The science board will determine the IACUC and have sole 
       responsibility for bonobo care and well-being
     d) Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh and Dr. Carmen Mate will be permanent
       members of the IPLS board.
