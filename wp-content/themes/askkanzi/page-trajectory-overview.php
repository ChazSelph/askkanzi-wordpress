<h2>Research Trajectory Overview</h2>

<p>The Research of BHI did not begin with a theory about what an ape could or could not do– it began with a question, just as the research of Kellogg Hayes and the Gardners began with: Can human language and culture be acquired by an ape?</p>


<p>It was never initially intended that these activities be acquired in the same manner, or to the same extent, as takes place in a human child. Thus the first effort with Lana chimpanzee was labeled a “Language Analogue.” And it is why the second efforts with chimpanzees Sherman and Austin was labeled, “Language Analogue Phase II. They did so well that eventually a second question occurred – could language and culture be naturally acquired by apes, as it is by children?</p>

<i class="fa-solid fa-lg fa-folder-tree"></i>


<p>This research began to change our perspective on evolution, culture, apes, ourselves, and humanity. Ape language research became largely responsible for the emergence of studies of cognitive behavior in animals and then for cultural studies of animal behavior and for the rise of evolutionary psychology.</p>


<p>As you come to understand this work you will realize study of the various scientific publications are necessary and there have been many.</p>


<p>However the multi-phase multi-generational nature of this project could not be fitted into with articles directed to specific documentations of various skills.</p>


<p>Studies with captive apes reveal that they have the potential to acquire language on their own – therefore they must be employing language in the wild. But researchers have not discovered it because it does not sound like language to our brains. Our anthropomorphic tendencies have caused us to look ONLY for replicas of ourselves.</p>


<p>Nationality and cultural identity arise from the same ego-centric place. We identify with and understand those most like us. And political power has been vested in those most like us, in every society. It has also been vested in males, because child-rearing has been traditionally assigned to females.
</p>

<p>But with rapid inter-continental travel, the internet, zoom and Iphone – identify is breaking down. We are learning that humans are human all over the world – but some cultural ways of being much more restrictive than others and those are being resisted now around the world.</p>


<p>We understand the need for scientific verification of these findings. We understood the contrary view of Tomasello, Matzuzawa, DeWaal, Taglialatela and others. These scientists however – elected not replicate the methods that produced real language. The had chosen to avoid the issue of rearing, avoid the issue of biculturality, avoid the issues of linking symbol to “meaning” – as opposed to “object.” If words were only paired associates to objects, a symbol such as “no” or “please” could never have been acquired by Lana – but they were. And they were not trained because it is not possible to train such a concept by paired associate technique. One can condition a button press to end – or to avoid a shock – and label that button “no.” But one cannot them ask a child or an ape trained in such a way – a question such as “Do you hear the dog barking” and receive “no” as an answer. And one cannot say “Do you KNOW where I went?” and have the child or the dog realize that this “know” is not the same as “no.” These understandings derive from what we call “syntax” + “word meaning” – but also something that require a common perception of and experiential participation world events that become cognitively parsed in similar ways. That takes place only through a) group bonding, b) positive emotional shared experience and understanding, c) shared expectations, d) synchronous brain activity, e) neural mirror imaging and quite possibility – as yet little understood quantum neural effects that derive from and ride upon a shared reality.</p>

<p>The early work done with Lana was very different from that done with Sherman and Austin but it significantly informed the later work. The same was true of the work done with Kanzi, it was very different from the work with preceded it, but significantly informed by that work.</p>


<p>Following the initial success of ape language projects, each project was met with many attempts to defund or interfere with the research. Opposition arose from scientists, new media, and biomedical organizations who opposed the research in principle. Opposition evoked fears of “Planet of the Apes.” Opposition also arose from also arose confused animal rightists who viewed any ape human interaction as wrong.</p>


<p>Ape themselves do not view interactions with humans or other species as “wrong.” Many individuals of different species have formed beautiful cross-species bonds. (polar bear and wolf photos). It is not intrinsically amoral for cross-species bonds to take place.  If it “feels” to some that the closeness of the relationship between species must be amoral –</p>


<p>ALL of the apes in the Language projects have passed away. No new projects have been funded.
The only exception are our bonobos, Kanzi, Nyota, Teco, Maisha, and Elykia … and language is being “shut out of their world.”</p>


<p>It is essential that these bonobos be permitted to continue to employ language, make stone tools, music and art, to access the forest in free conditions, access at their wish Homo members of the bicultural family, and to reproduce and transmit their culture to other bonobos</p>

<p>The bicultural language program was thefted and closed by parties committed to seeing that true language interchanges are terminated and never allowed to begin again.</p>


<p>
Join our call for the immediate release of Kanzi and family from their current conditions of imprisonment and bicultural isolation. (insert link) And our call for these bonobos to be give the opportunity to communicate with other apes through the internet and the preparation for the “Return to Congo Project” so that may live free, and continue to provide their sibling species with greater understanding of close relationship.</p>
